# a11y-laws

Right now the only sane resource that compares some of the different laws regarding Web Accessibility is [this section on World Laws at webaim.org](http://webaim.org/articles/laws/world/).

This is a try at making something that both makes it easier to compare laws between countries while at the same time contains a lot of information. Time will tell what will become of this. It will probably not be successful without more contributors.
